//! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/danieldulaney/appendlist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/danieldulaney/appendlist)
//!
//! This list lets you add new things to the end, even if you're holding a reference
//! to something already inside it.
//!
//! When should you use it?
//!
//! - You need to insert into a list while its other elements are borrowed
//! - You have so much data that `Vec` reallocations are significant
//!
//! When shouldn't you use it?
//!
//! - You are storing indices into a list, rather than actual references (just use
//!   `Vec<T>`)
//! - `Vec` reallocations don't matter very much (normally the case!)
//!
//! What are some features?
//!
//! - A `push(&self, item: T)` method (you'd expect `push(&mut self, item: T)`)
//! - Non-amortized constant-time insertions and indexes (normally insertions are
//!   *amortized* constant-time, like `Vec`, or indexing is linear-time, like `LinkedList`)
//! - You can hold onto references in the list
//! - Only a single line of unsafe code
//!
//! ## What does this let me do?
//!
//! This example fails to compile because `second_element` has a reference into
//! `list` when `list.push()` is called.
//!
//! ```rust compile_fail
//! let list: Vec<u32> = (1..=10).collect();
//!
//! let second_element = &list[1];
//!
//! list.push(11); // Push needs &mut self, but list is already borrowed
//!
//! assert_eq!(*second_element, 2); // Fails to compile
//! ```
//!
//! But if you just swap in `AppendList` for `Vec`, everything works!
//!
//! ```rust
//! use appendlist::AppendList;
//!
//! let list: AppendList<u32> = (1..=10).collect();
//!
//! let second_element = &list[1];
//!
//! list.push(11); // Push only needs &self, so this works fine
//!
//! assert_eq!(*second_element, 2); // All OK!
//! ```
//!
//! ## What's all this about reallocations?
//!
//! In general, `Vec`s are pretty cool, and you should use them by default. But they
//! have a weakness: when you create
//! one, it gets created with a finite amount of space. When it runs out of space,
//! it needs to reallocate: grab a new hunk of memory (usually twice as big as
//! the current one) and copy everything over, then release the old memory.
//!
//! Reallocations take O(n) time to do: you need to copy all n elements in the list.
//! But you don't have to do them very often: only O(log n) reallocations are needed
//! to do n insertions (for the current `Vec` implementation). In fact, the
//! reallocations are rare enough that if you spread
//! them out across all the insertions, they just add a constant extra time.
//! This is why the Rust docs say that `Vec` has "O(1) *amortized*
//! push" -- it generally takes constant time to push and it occasionally takes linear
//! time, but if you spread out those expensive pushes over all the cheap pushes,
//! it's still constant.
//!
//! Reallocations have another issue: any reference to an element inside the `Vec`
//! is invalidated. If you have a reference to one of the elements when it gets
//! copied over, your reference has no way of knowing its new location and will
//! still point to the old location, which is now invalid memory. Using that reference
//! would be a use-after-free bug, so Rust forces you to have no references into a
//! `Vec` before you push another element on, just in case that push would reallocate.
//!
//! The `AppendList` solves both issues by keeping a `Vec` of chunks of data. When
//! you push a new element on, it goes to the end of the current chunk. If the chunk
//! is full, rather than reallocate it, `AppendList` creates a whole new chunk that
//! starts off empty. Each
//! chunk is double the size of the last chunk, so only O(log n) allocations are
//! needed, and each one takes constant time (for most allocators) rather than linear
//! time. By eliminating reallocations, an `AppendList` gives you a couple of benefits
//! compared to `Vec`:
//!
//! - You can keep your references while pushing
//! - You don't have to pay the occasional linear reallocate-and-copy cost
//!
//! However, it also comes with some drawbacks:
//!
//! - Indexing takes longer (you have to index into a chunk, then into your item)
//! - CPU cache behavior might be somewhat worse near a chunk boundary (because the
//!   next chunk isn't generally contiguous)
//!
//! ## So should I use this crate?
//!
//! Probably not.
//!
//! In general, you should just use a `Vec` and keep track of indices rather than
//! references. But if keeping references is very important, then this is your solution.

/// A list that can be appended to while elements are borrowed
///
/// This looks like a fairly bare-bones list API, except that it has a `push`
/// method that works on non-`mut` lists. It is safe to hold references to
/// values inside this list and push a new value onto the end.
///
/// Additionally, the list has O(1) index and O(1) push (not amortized!).
///
/// For example, this would be illegal with a `Vec`:
///
/// ```
/// use appendlist::AppendList;
///
/// let list = AppendList::new();
///
/// list.push(1);
/// let first_item = &list[0];
/// list.push(2);
/// let second_item = &list[1];
///
/// assert_eq!(*first_item, list[0]);
/// assert_eq!(*second_item, list[1]);
/// ```
///
/// # Implementation details
///
/// This section is not necessary to use the API, it just describes the underlying
/// allocation and indexing strategies.
///
/// The list is a `Vec` of *chunks*. Each chunk is itself a `Vec<T>`. The list
/// will fill up a chunk, then allocate a new chunk with its full capacity.
/// Because the capacity of a given chunk never changes, the underlying `Vec<T>`
/// never reallocates, so references to that chunk are never invalidated. Each
/// chunk is twice the size of the previous chunk, so there will never be more
/// than O(log(n)) chunks.
///
/// Constant-time indexing is achieved because the chunk ID of a particular index
/// can be quickly calculated: if the first chunk has size c, index i will be
/// located in chunk floor(log2(i + c) - log2(c)). If c is a power of 2, this
/// is equivalent to floor(log2(i + c)) - floor(log2(c)), and a very fast floor
/// log2 algorithm can be derived from `usize::leading_zeros()`.
